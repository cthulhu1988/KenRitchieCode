# KenRitchieCode
Working through Kernighan and Ritchie's opus on C. 
Typing out and experimenting with the code that is in the book. 

Working in the Atom Editor on Arch Linux and compiling in the terminal using gcc.

On page 29 is an exercise that implements a getline and copy function. This is shown in getLineandCopy.c 
If you do not change getline() to something else if thinks you are referencing the newer C function getline(). 
I just renamed mine to Getline() to get around that error. Note that Ctl+d is used as the EOF character.
